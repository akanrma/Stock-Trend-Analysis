# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Prediction and Analysis

A Python-based machine learning project that forecasts stock price trends using deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). This project demonstrates how to preprocess historical stock data and use neural networks to capture time-dependent relationships for more accurate stock trend predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Predicts future stock price trends using historical data
- âœ… Implements LSTM and RNN models
- âœ… Preprocessing of time-series financial data
- âœ… Visualization of predicted vs actual trends
- âœ… Comparison with traditional statistical models

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


## ðŸ“Š Results

Our models (especially LSTM) demonstrated **improved accuracy** over traditional statistical methods by effectively modeling the time-dependent nature of stock prices.

> ðŸ“Œ Note: Stock prediction is inherently uncertain. This project is for educational purposes and **not for financial trading or investment advice**.
